# Apriori Algorithm for Market Basket Optimization

## Overview

This project implements the Apriori algorithm to identify associations between products in a market basket dataset. The goal is to find frequent itemsets and generate association rules that can help uncover product relationships, such as “which items are frequently bought together.” These insights can be useful for retail strategies like product placement, cross-selling, and inventory management.

## Project Structure

- **Code**: The project is implemented in Python using Jupyter Notebook.
- **Dataset**: The dataset consists of 7,500 transactions, with each transaction containing a list of products purchased together.
- **Model**: The Apriori algorithm is applied to the dataset to generate frequent itemsets and association rules.

## Dataset

- The dataset includes 7,500 rows, each representing a transaction.
- Each row contains up to 20 items, with each column representing a product.
- The dataset was preprocessed to convert the transactions into a format suitable for association rule mining.

## Key Technologies

- **Python Libraries**: `apyori`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`
- **Algorithms**: Apriori Algorithm

## Steps to Reproduce

### 1. Install Dependencies

Install the necessary libraries by running:

```python
!pip install apyori
```

### 2. Data Preprocessing

- Load the dataset using pandas.
- Convert the dataset into a list of transactions.

### 3. Training the Apriori Model

- The Apriori algorithm is applied with the following hyperparameters:
- min_support: 0.003
- min_confidence: 0.2
- min_lift: 3
- min_length: 2
- max_length: 2
- These parameters ensure that the rules generated are both statistically significant and relevant.

### 4. Results

- The resulting association rules are displayed in two formats:
- Unsorted Results: The raw results generated by the Apriori algorithm.
- Sorted by Lift: The top 10 rules, sorted by their lift values to showcase the strongest associations between products.

### 5. Output

- The output is organized into a Pandas DataFrame with columns:
- Left Hand Side (LHS): The first item in the rule.
- Right Hand Side (RHS): The item associated with LHS.
- Support: How frequently the items appear together.
- Confidence: The probability that RHS will be bought if LHS is bought.
- Lift: How much more likely the RHS is to be bought when LHS is bought.

## Key Results

The top association rules reveal interesting insights about product pairings. For example:

- Rule 1: fromage blanc ➞ honey with a lift of 5.164271.
- Rule 2: light cream ➞ chicken with a lift of 4.843951.

These rules can guide marketing strategies such as cross-selling or product recommendations.
